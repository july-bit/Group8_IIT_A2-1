                    <h6>The following is the opinions of three other students within the group regarding this particular
                        team member.</h6>
                    <!-- Thu's feedback -->
                    <h5>Anh Thu</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Vu is a dedicated and hard-working member, and he helped me a lot with the team
                        website design. Since his major is Professional Communication, Vu creates detailed and
                        well-written content for his part in Assignment 2. Vu has experience in many fields that gives
                        him a broad knowledge not only in IT industries and technologies but also in different areas. He
                        also has good analytical and research skills, and I am very thankful to have this big brother on
                        the team.</p>
                    <!-- Tri's feedback -->
                    <h5>Minh Tri</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Vu has always been a helpful team member, and his diligence has aided us
                        greatly throughout the project. His content in Assignment 2 is meticulously researched and
                        written, demonstrating how much time he spent on it. He is also in charge of web design and our
                        assignment 3 mock up. Due to his gifted ability to design, our web has turned out to be even
                        more delightful, and I believe his ability will aid us greatly in assignment 3. Vu's presence on
                        our team has been a pleasure, and I look forward to working with him in the future.
                    </p>
                    <!-- My's feedback -->
                    <h5>Thao My</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">A supportive team player with a multilayer toolkit and a wide range of
                        knowledge. My first impression of him was filled with admiration for his level of work
                        experience and life skills. That level of affinity surely only increased while working with each
                        other and seeing how contributive he is to the group's communications and progress. With his
                        expertise in design and report writing, Vu forms the backbone that strongly supports both our
                        web development and game mockup phases. His observation and analytical skills come in handy when
                        we have multiple viewpoints, wherein his sharing almost always points us to the right direction.
                        His consistent level of professionalism is evidenced by immeasurable hard work and rich life
                        experiences, something I find lacking in myself. It was a pleasure working with Vu and learning
                        tons of helpful tips and tricks around RMIT from him.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Myself</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Although I did pull my own weight in the past weeks, I wish I could have contributed more
                        especially in the technical department (i.e. coding) which would have lessened the workload of
                        my teammates. At this stage, I am planning to divert all my efforts in creating visual mockups
                        for our third assignment, alongside the presentation slides, helping the others with the scripts
                        and do my parts for the report.
