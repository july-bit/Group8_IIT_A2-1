       <h3> What is Artificial Intelligence? </h3>
       <p>
           The term “Artificial Intelligence” is no longer unfamiliar to the majority of students, as it has been
           featured in numerous articles and research studies. Through Artificial intelligence, computers can obtain
           the data and learning needed to not only perform desirable actions and produce informed decisions, but to
           continuously improve without humans explaining every step. Currently, the field of artificial intelligence
           has experienced tremendous growth and progress stemming from deep government funding and research being
           conducted. In the medical sector, Artificial Intelligence was the main driving factor which expedited the
           vaccine developments during the Covid-19 pandemic. Specifically, AI was used in the delivery, surveillance,
           and tracking process of the vaccine development. For example, a study integrated multiple modelling to
           approximate the infectious disease vulnerability index (IDVI) of the pandemic during the early phases of
           Wuhan breakout (Bogoch et al., 2020). In addition, symptom screening through online surveys and travel
           location have been implemented to build an effective Covid-19 AI prediction system (Arora et al., 2021).
 
           <br>
           In the recognition sector, Artificial Intelligence has achieved significant milestones in both speech and
           image recognition. Far from being flawless or entirely accurate, however, speech recognition has been
           implemented and integrated in several key applications, including keyboard speech to text recognition or
           virtual assistants. Prime examples include the popular Siri, Cortana or Alexa, all using speech recognition
           as a way to receive users’ input. Apart from listening and recognizing user input, Google Assistant can now
           even make phone calls for reservations and respond to real-time speech input. Through Apple’s built-in text
           in images recognition in the iOS 15.0 system update, users can now select texts in real-time or in captured
           images effortlessly.
 
           <br>
           In the next three years, advancements in Reinforcement learning and Synthetic data will likely create
           impacts on the development of Artificial Intelligence. Reinforcement Learning is one of the three main
           machine learning paradigms, along with supervised learning and unsupervised learning. With the absence of a
           supervisor, the learner (the program) will independently learn the routes or desirable tasks needed in order
           to obtain the maximum number of rewards. Advancements with this technology empowers machine learning
           programs to learn from in-bound experience in the absence of a training datasets, or to advance by
           outbeating itself. Meanwhile, synthetic data refers to the artificially created data computed by computer
           based on algorithms rather than historical record. Luciano (2019) emphasised that synthetic data possesses a
           few key advantages, most notably the reliability and flexibility of data generation, the absence of privacy
           or confidentiality issues, and increased speed of new data generated. In a future where the quality and
           curation of data will be prioritised compared to the mass quantity of data, the likelihood of credible data
           sources for artificial intelligence training will decrease. Thus, developing a well-defined and coherent
           synthetic data source will play a main role in improving the state of artificial intelligence advancements.
           <br>
           A prime credential of the incredible impact we’ll achieve through reinforcement learning and synthetic data
           lies in the latest machine learning computer AlphaZero, developed by Google DeepMind. Even more advanced
           than IBM's Deep Blue that once defeated the world’s champion Garry Kasparov in the game of chess, AlphaZero
           achieved the pinnacle of AI-driven chess playing and has a world-record performance, unsurpassed by any
           human player. The key highlight here is that AlphaZero received no external training data input. It relies
           on self-driven learning of the game’s rules and outlined its own synthetic data with reinforcement learning.
           <!-- What is the likely impact? ​ -->
       <h3> What is the likely impact? </h3>
       <p>
           The potential impact as AI developers progress to research and integrate synthetic data in Machine Learning
           will likely improve the current state of Artificial Intelligence. Reinforcement learning - the Machine
           Learning training model based on reward maximisation may set revolution as it may help us achieve Artificial
           General Intelligence (AGI). AGI is the ability of computers to adapt and self-integrate into new
           environments, exhibiting human-like characteristics and skills. It’s the opposite of narrow artificial
           intelligence, where the computer needs to be reprogrammed whenever the scope of the environment exceeds the
           computer’s training input (Goertzel, 2014). DeepMind, the Artificial Intelligence research and developer
           group behind AlphaZero, stated that Reinforcement learning exhibits various potentials for the achievement
           of AGM since it imitates the reward-focused and trial-and-error system humans have deployed since the
           evolution (Silver et al., 2021). In addition, Reinforcement Learning is also expected to catalyse the
           process of developing personalised web pages. By focusing on maximising the clickthrough rate (CTR) on the
           news section on Yahoo!, Li et al., (2010), applied reinforcement learning and yielded a dramatic increase in
           user attractions and user-per-clicks over a set period of time. This change may bring many positive
           employment prospects, including new positions centred for the research and development of this new
           technology. Overtime, as synthetic data and reinforcement learning become more applicable, corporations and
           companies may need human resources to transform their digital portfolio into these.
           <br>
           However, the ethical dilemma that artificial intelligence may come close to replacing human jobs remains a
           controversial and noteworthy issue. As artificial intelligence systems get researched and developed more, it
           will progress from automating some aspects of a job, to replacing the entire job completely once it’s
           trained carefully enough to do so (Auto and Dorn, 2013). The development of artificial intelligence using
           synthetic data and reinforcement learning may expedite this process as it allows for increased accuracy
           training models and increased data training. Hence, repeatable, predictable tasks such as those found in
           manufacturing jobs have been at risk for AI replacement. In the future, even communication-based and
           emotion-centred tasks in the service industry may be replaced as artificial general intelligence is
           sufficiently developed, opening doors for computers to imitate and replicate human feelings.

       <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
       <p>
           This development in artificial intelligence means that there will be increased employment opportunities in
           the Technology industry, potentially receiving increased funding for research and development. This will
           likewise affect the job prospects of many technology roles. For example, many of the analytical and
           repeating tasks in the job of a data analyst may potentially be automated as well, giving the person time to
           prioritise more difficult tasks such as data analysis, collaborating for writing reports, or building
           dashboards. (Huang and Rust, 2018).
 
           <br>
           Also, the proliferating advancement in artificial intelligence will also open gates for increased access to
           advanced research across different fields. Most notably, breakthroughs in medical research and development
           using AI would provide immeasurable benefits to humankind. As mentioned above, AI was the main factor behind
           the expedited development and delivery process of Covid-19 vaccinations. With such clear potentials, the
           later advancements of Artificial Intelligence will give rise to potentially more valuable and life-changing
           medical advancements, giving humans increased control of our health. As I’m beginning to observe more
           illness signs on my parents as they age, this level of advancement helps me feel relieved as I believe
           Vietnam is and will increasingly adopt a high-class, intricate level of medical research as time passes by.
           <br>
           Also, the level of advancements portrayed through applications of reinforcement learning such as in
           personalised web pages will revolutionise many marketing principles. For example, the need to apply A/B
           Testing, a method that segregates the audience to see and use two different versions, may be rendered
           obsolete as this feature no longer supports personalised marketing. Meanwhile, personalised marketing or
           mass customization may receive tremendous funding in the future, transforming business systems and
           mainstream marketing principles. This would affect how any one relying on the internet experience marketing,
           immersing in tailored products displaying in every corner of our surfing activity.
