       <h3> What kind of work is done by the IT professional? </h3>
       <p>
           Ha is currently a data analyst at Unbounce, a SASS landing page builder company located in Canada. According
           to Ha, most of her time is spent on four tasks, outlined below:
       <ol>
           <li>
               BI Reporting - setting up reports or dashboards to track KPI. According to Ha, every time there’s a new
               feature release, the first thing a data analyst needs to do is to work with the developers and marketers
               to collaborate and define an appropriate “adoption metric” — how customers are interacting with the
               product and whether they return after using it.
               <br>
               Building an accurate adoption metric is essential to track and build KPI reports. She also noted that
               it’s normal if analysts don’t fully comprehend how new products or features are developed and deployed.
               In that case, they should communicate with developers to understand its use cases and unique selling
               points.
           </li>
           <li>
               Statistical analysis: deeper analysis using statistical report
               <br>
               Analysts are responsible to also solve stakeholders’ inquiries about the nature of the feature/product.
               For example, they may ask the data analyst about customer behaviour information, such as customer
               retention or how likely customers stayed to use the product.
 
           </li>
           <li>
               Meetings with teams, stakeholder, interrelated departments such as Marketing, Development Team, etc.
               These are essential for daily line-ups, weekly meetings and updates, or working to compose the
               aforementioned adoption metric. This means that Communication and project management are essential
               skills to obtain as a data analyst.
 
           </li>
           <li>
               ETL process: Extract - Transform - Load
               <br>
               Data analysts are responsible for retrieving data from various sources, applying business logic and
               transforming that data and then loading them into the company warehouse.
           </li>
       </ol>
       Meanwhile, Stefanovic is likewise a data analyst. Although he doesn’t disclose which company he works for, he
       publishes a detailed and helpful “Day in the life of a data analyst” on his Youtube Channel (Stefanovic, 2021).
       Here, we can observe that his day is mostly spent on building the company’s dashboard, cleaning and processing
       data/raw input, and communicating with different stakeholders. It’s clear that they both spend time on the ETL
       process and communicating with others in meetings.

           Clients? Investors? The general public?
       </h3>
       <p>
           In Ha’s case, the data analyst is responsible for communicating with the marketing and developer teams for
           the BI reporting phase. Also, they need to work with stakeholders to answer their inquiries about products
           and services. Stefanovic shares a similar pattern when he said that data analysts need to interact with
           developers to build the dashboard, as well as communicate with stakeholders to answer questions about the
           dashboard development.
 
       </p>
 
       <!-- Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time?  -->
       <h3>Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time? </h3>
       <p>
           Ha answered this question in her video by sharing that her time seems to be evenly distributed based on the
           phase of the product launching/development. One of the most significant aspects seems to be data processing
           and dashboard building. She shared that data analysts may also be asked to use statistical reports to
           conduct deep data analysis. These processes may take a significant amount of time from the data analyst as
           well.
           <br>
           Similarly, Stefanovic reported that a data analyst needs to spend most of the time processing information
           and data given from data engineers, build an updated dashboard given those inputs, and attend daily team
           meetings and buildings. Thus, data processing and dashboard development seem to take a majority of the data
           analyst’s time in both of Ha and Stefanovic’s cases.

       <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>
       <p>
           Ha shared that the most challenging aspect of her position seems to be communicating with different
           departments and establishing an accurate adoption metric. Since this report varies overtime as the
           product/feature develops, the data analyst needs to have a thorough understanding by communicating with the
           development team on a long term basis. Also, they must keep their report up to date and refined with every
           new product update. This requires the data analyst to exhibit ample communication and writing skills, as
           well as a strong technology and business foundation.
           <br>
           Meanwhile, Stefanovic shared that the most challenging aspect of the position was in the dashboard
           development phase. Specifically, whenever errors appeared in the dashboard, he needed to explain how
           sometimes the fault lies in the inaccuracy of the given data and not entirely the data analysts’ work.
           Despite being a rather humorous remark, it signifies that the dashboard development phase involves various
           challenges and is rather time-consuming.
