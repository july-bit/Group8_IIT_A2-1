       <h3> What kind of work is done by the IT professional? </h3>
       <p>
           Christine works as a UX Designer for Instacart - a groceries delivery platform - in San Francisco (though
           interestingly, she used the term “Product Designer” more throughout her video). She clarified that the term
           “product designer” is not to be confused with physical products i.e. industrial design, but instead digital
           application, software, and websites; hence, the interchangeability with “UI/UX Designer” (User
           Interface/User Experience). Christine was responsible for designing the onboarding experience for Instacart,
           specifically the “shopper app” for those who wanted to make a side income to successfully sign up and use
           the service (chunbuns 2020).
 
           <br>
           Yet, her role does not stop at designing interfaces for apps and websites alone. She revealed that it was a
           much more involved process from start to finish, where she had to come up with product strategy, ideated
           visual and interaction design, conducting user research and other forms of data gathering, and strategizing
           content (chunbuns 2020).
 
           <br>
           Chrsitine splitted her work into three portion outlined as below:
           <li>
               <b>Design (50%):</b> This is where she would come up with ideas for the visual and interaction parts of
               a design, ideate content and the copy for the apps/website that she is responsible for, and finally
               design audit, where she had to make sure all of the design elements used, as well as verbal and written
               content, adhere to Instacart brand guidelines.
 
           </li>
           <li>
               <b>Meeting (30%):</b> Where she meets with her project manager or teammates to discuss product
               strategies and directions. She also mentioned a “design critique” session that was held every afternoon
               so that designers could review each other’s works, give feedback, and bounce ideas back and forth.
 
           </li>
           <li>
               <b>Data (20%):</b>The more dry and unexciting part of her job, but crucial in informing her design
               decisions. This is where she had to devise research proposals, protocols, interview guidelines, and
               conduct primary research via interviews (either remotely or face-to-face). She also handled usability
               tests to see which part of her design worked and which did not.

       <p>
           As her role is not exactly customer-facing, Christine spent the bulk of her time working in the back office,
           communicating and working with her teammates instead. She shared that on Monday, her teams usually had
           Weekly Standups where everyone would share updates and status on the projects they were working on.
           Nevertheless, she still had to manage several stakeholders’ expectations. These include: product managers,
           software engineers, and cross functional teams (e.g. legal, operation, marketing teams; chunbuns 2020).

       <p>
           At the time of her video, Christine was still able to commute and work in her office as the COVID-19
           pandemic was yet to escalate in May 2020. She also described a “huddle room” in her 2018 video, where she
           would spend time “whiteboarding” and sketching out her ideas in the morning as she felt it was the period
           where she was most productive (chunbuns 2018).

       <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>
       <p>
           As she was expected to present her ideas and works to a variety of audiences, Christine had to figure out
           how much context to give and how technical she needed to be depending on who she was presenting to.
           “Designing is only half the work” (chunbuns 2020). Thus, being able to communicate effectively to get both
           designers and non-designers behind her ideas is another obstacle that she faces everyday.
 
           <br>
           Dee Scarano from CareerFoundry shared that to be successful in this role, a UX Designer need to be a good
           listener, empathy towards others, open-mindedness, love solving problems, being detail-oriented whilst at
           the same time being able to see the big picture (CareerFoundry 2021).
