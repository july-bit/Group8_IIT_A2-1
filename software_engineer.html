            Rahul Pandey, a Staff Software Engineer at Facebook, has been working in Silicon Valley for eight years.
            He's also a professor teaching an Android class at Stanford University, and a Youtuber who posts coding
            interview videos. Pandey is also a product engineer whose responsibilities include both frontend and backend
            of the products. As he mentioned, half of his day is to do technical chores such as reading, writing, and
            modifying codes, and submitting GitHub pull requests. He spends the other half of his time reviewing
            architecture, assisting people, unblocking them, and providing other ways to tackle the problems.

            Rahul Pandey enjoys connecting with others, and his job requires him to work as part of a team and engage
            with other professionals such as the engineering manager, product manager, and designer to develop a
            strategy for the entire team. As a professor, he has to interact with his students at Stanford University.
            He also makes videos on Youtuber to communicate and teach other people about coding. (Mihailescu, C 2021)

            Rahul Pandey did not share where he spent most of his time. However, as a professor, he could spend part of
            his time at Stanford University and the rest of his time in front of his table doing technical things as a
            staff software engineer. (Mihailescu, C 2021)

            Rahul Pandey shared about his year-long project that his team had to integrate the architecture made by
            another team in the company into their product. His duty is to examine the design and try to figure out the
            potential problems. Besides the engineering challenge, he has to face marketing and communication challenges
            such as convincing people who work on the new feature on the architecture and helping others understand the
            value of this architecture. (Mihailescu, C 2021)
